# Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Urban Crime

## Project Description
This project involves **analyzing and predicting urban crime patterns** using publicly available NYC crime data. The goal is to **forecast crime intensity by location and time**, helping to gain insights into urban safety trends and identify high-risk areas.

The analysis includes:  
- Exploring the spatio-temporal distribution of crimes in NYC.  
- Visualizing crime patterns across different neighborhoods and time periods.  
- Building predictive models to estimate crime intensity using machine learning techniques.  

**Dataset:**  
The dataset used is publicly available from the NYC Police Department, containing records of reported crimes in New York City. 

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used for analysis and visualization:  
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
